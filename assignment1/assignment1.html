		  <p>Wagner's main themes about the past and future of the Internet, were two ideas that expressed this means of communication.  One is that all content on the Internet, despite some popular beliefs, is something that will not be preserved forever. The essays, blogs, postings and articles are content that will indeed eventually effectively disappear as it will either be on a platform that is shut down, or become unfindable because the links to that content does not always remain maintained. On the other hand, the designs and user interfaces that are used by this means of communication is something that will endure far beyond the content. There are several examples of how the design of the Internet has influenced how the content was created, but also how it stuck around and has been used for retro style, and also as a means to make a statement against unpopular content against other users. </p>
		  
   <p> Wagner has pointed out that she used to hear warnings from people about posting and putting content online. There was a belief, because the content was not on physical media that could be destroyed, that content would live forever. Wagner says "Considering the average website is less than ten years old, that old warning from your parents that says to “be careful what you post online because it’ll be there forever” is like the story your dad told you about chocolate milk coming from brown cows, a well-meant farce."  But as the Internet continues on, it's been proven that content does indeed get lost more often than destroyed, or simply deleted away as the company profiting off of your free content is no longer making money from it and they shut down.  Content may not last or the words remembered, but the designs and interfaces that people used to create that content for years is burned into their memory, and the design lives on longer that the content. </p>
		  
		  <p>The Internet used to be a place of scientists and professionals. Mostly text based. When the general public was invited platforms were invented for them to easily add their own content, but the design was a mess. When very large companies started to monetize people's content - from the FAANG companies, the designs became far more elegant, as money was spent on the user interfaces. Wagner quotes "capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love” —online it happens in real time." 
User's started to rebel against the corporate aesthetic of beautiful user interfaces during a movement Wagner calls 'Vaporwave'.  User's intentionally injected retro looking colors and haphazard designs and icons from long dead platforms to reclaim a bit of ownership that users used to have over the design of Web pages. </p>
		  
		 <p> Younger users are now fighting against older, conservative users that were swayed by Facebook and Twitter's massive amounts of disinformation by using out-dated purposefully poorly created gifs and images to make fun of the out-of-touch 'Boomers'.  "The Twitter accounts “Cursed Boomer Images” and “Absurd Conservamemes” post fresh outpourings from the depths of poorly designed, politically noxious, brainworm-ridden Facebook depravity." In this way users are weaponizing designs as a statement against the content of disinformation by using old and unpleasant designs to parody and draw attention to the bad actors. </p>
		  
		 <p> In conclusion, much like fashion and film, the designs, looks and styles from the past will always outlive the content, or the people that wore them. Users of the Internet are savvy and have nostalgia for their initial experience with the Internet and Web pages as much as their fashion choices and styles of films they used to watch. Design can give comfort in a modern use to give us that nostalgic experience, but Wagner also remarks that is a powerful way to ridicule people and make them more visible for their dangerous and outdated ways of thinking about society, and as a way of expression against the corporate takeover of what they used to love so much about the Internet itself. </p>
